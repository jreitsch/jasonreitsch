## My website/portfolio
Mostly made this just to get more experience using git.
Writing this, and all past and future edits and commits, from command line.

As of this writing (12/01/15) the core of this site is from my first
lessons at [Treehouse](https://teamtreehouse.com/ "Team Treehouse"). It's been modified, played with,
destroyed and rebuilt a few times, but that's the source of the original.

You can see the site live, of course, at [my portfolio site](http://www.jasonreitsch.com "My Site!")
